<!-- How to Interpret User Needs and Match with A Program.

User needs are satisfied with product development which uses a specific program by scrum to develop. The scrum team uses sprint to lay a program that ensures the product for a specific user need. User stories play a crucial part in the program's development by providing a base for developing a product. User stories are supported by tasks reviewed in daily scrum meetings for agile testing to help correct inefficiencies in the program. The program is then passed through sprint review, which helps explains the process to shareholders for the implementation to function. The program will be used to produce products to match the user's needs. 
How to Develop Program.


When developing a program, embrace the SAfe lean-agile principles, which help guide an effective program in a business. The effective program process is first to understand the user's needs and have an economic view of the system. The program development should be effective in terms of the expenses in development and maintenance. The running cost should consider the program's satisfaction with the user. Secondly, have systematic thinking and embrace options in the development of the program. Systematic thinking involves integrating the system to best serve the users with well-developed user stories. Having variable options in the program development enables better ways to adjust to serve the user. Choose and formalize the program by choosing a scrum team to ensure the program's functionality is effective. While developing the program, embrace agile testing to be able to adjust inefficiencies on time.
