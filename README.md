# Spring-Review-and-Retrospective


The scrum master's job in the scrum process includes leading the team to improved performance. He supports the team's learning and application of scrum and all related agile techniques. Also,
he oversees the accomplishment of the product objectives while facilitating the scrum events (Spiegler, Heinicke & Wagner,2019). For the development team to determine how to meet the client's expectations, the product owner makes sure he is evident in the business interest. A tester strives to guarantee that a high-quality product is created.
